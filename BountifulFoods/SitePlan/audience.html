          <p>Macia Lopez is a client who places great value on the purchase of quality 
            fruits and vegetables. She has long since fought for the need for local 
            schools to removed junk foods, and to replace them with freshly growth 
            fruits and vegetables. Realizing that fresh fruits are the most expensive 
            food items in U.S. households she has sought to make fresh fruits and 
            vegetables available and affordable. Together we are working to ensure 
            our children have healthier options at home and at school.</p>

          <p>Angela Davidson, who is a manager at Spouts Farmers Market, and  like
            many of my clients places great value on eating healthy. She has been
            a life long advocate of the World Health Organization who advocates 
            for a healthy diet for all. WHO explains that a healthy  diet throughout 
            life not only prevents malnutrition, but also minimizes the risk of 
            obesity  and a complete range of noncommunicable diseases. WHO 
            supports healthy choices of eating fruits and vegetables rather than 
            foods rich in fat, salt, and sugar.
            We have been working to supply Spouts with a multitude of specialty
            fruits so customers will have a variety of options to spark their interest
            of eating healthily.
