    <h1 class="aboutTitle">About us</h1>
    <p>In 1996, David White, a 4th generation farmer realized the need to change the way 
      he sold his produce. Over the last 10 years, he watched fellow farmers struggle to 
      make a living, becoming frustrated, and finally pack up and leave the farm in 
      search of a better way of life. Being concerned about our country’s ability to 
      self-sustain, David held a local meeting and came up with a way for farmers to 
      unite in their cause and to produce and distribute their foods in a way that would 
      have a wider reach. David wanted a store where fruits that were locally grown would 
      be sold. He wanted produce from local farmer who he knew would grow their fruits 
      with care and free of pesticides and fertilizers. 1 year later David opened the doors 
      to Bountiful Foods. 
      Today Bountiful Foods not only supplies fruits and juice blends to local communities, 
      but we have now reached international levels, selling and purchasing and locally grown 
      fruits and specialty fruits  all over the globe.

    <h2 class="aboutTitle">History of Carlsbad, California</h2>
    <p>Nicknamed, "The Village By the Sea", Carlsbad is a coastal resort city located in the 
      North County region of San Diego County, California. The city is 87 miles long, and has a 
      population of 114,746. It has a semi-arid Mediterranean climate and averages 263 sunny 
      days per year. Winters are mild with periodic rain. 
    
      The earliest residents were the Luiseno Indians who settled along the coastal area. These Natives
      were here at the time when the Spanish arrived in the 16th Century. 1882 Captain John Frazier 
      dug a well near the coast in Carlsbad. He would then offered his water at the train station. The
      train station became known as Frazier’s Station. The water started to become famously known for 
      its mineral content and chemical makeup, which was similar to the waters at Karlsbad, where
      Carlsbad was named after. Carlsbad is today a popular tourist destination, and has the most 
      renowned spas in the world.
