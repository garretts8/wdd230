      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the Bountiful Foods website is to advertise the availability of fresh,
        locally grown fruits, and to make known the nutrition value of our beverages. As Americans
        become more health conscious, the fruit and juice industry has grown, competing with 
        flavored water.  Our aim is to support healthy choices, by making locally grown, fresh 
        fruits more readily available, and at an affordable cost.  Along with providing a variety 
        of hard-to-find specialty fruits, we also provide freshly made fruit juice blends which 
        are chock full of needed vitamins and minerals that soda and sports drinks donâ€™t have. 
        Our customer and clients deserve the best, and we aim to provide it just that.
